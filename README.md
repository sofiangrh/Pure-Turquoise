# Pure-Turquoise
It is a very simplified version of Alecive's "Pure" Metacity theme (part of the "A New Start" GNOME theme). Visit http://alecive.deviantart.com/ or http://gnome-look.org/usermanager/search.php?username=alecive&action=contents for further information about the original. Also thanks for the creators of the classic Clearlooks engine.

# Installation
Copy the Pure_turquoise folder to ./themes

# Note 
> The ergonomic titlebar: if is only visible if you use that window.
